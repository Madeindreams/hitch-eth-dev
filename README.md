# A Hitchhiker's Guide to Ethereum Development

So you want to learn solidity and dive into the smart contract world but you are not sure where to start?
Well your at the right place at the right time. I have decided it's time to have a comprehensive guide the
introduce all the newcomers to this thriving blockchain trend. Wheater you are here to create an ERC20 token, some NFTs or even an amitious project such as a DEX or a hot DEFI opportunirty. This is where it all start. And if you don't understamd all these new terms, well keep reading.

## ERC what?

To make it simple, the Ethereum network runs a big virtual machine where you can store contract and information on thje blockchain. The Ethereum Virtual Machine. And there are certain standards for everyone to  understand eachothers. ERC stand for Ethereum Request for Comment and 20 is the proposal.

You got it! The ERC20 is the standard for creating tokens that can be used on the Ethereum network. This guide will cover the ERC20 and ERC721 standard. But before we can create our own tokens or smart contract, we need an environment to work on. This guide will use the Linux environement under windows.

It might be a good idea to start from a fresh OS installation if your not familiar with linux command.
